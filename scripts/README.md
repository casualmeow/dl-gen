## shell scripts

here you can find the next scripts:

```sh
node no-docker-start.js
```
> allows user to start the backend and frontend without using docker compose.
```sh
./merge-gitignore.bat
```
> by that script user can merge .gitgnore from frontend and backend to root folder 

#### DEPRECATED
```sh
node admin-auth.js
```
> while starting backend you can see the hash key. if you start the script and enter that hash key you will get access to the /admin/ endpoint
